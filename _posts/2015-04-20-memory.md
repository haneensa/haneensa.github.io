If you have a struct like the following, could you predict its size?

<pre>
/* assuming 64 bit machine */
struct human {
    int age;        /* 4 bytes */
    char *name;     /* 8 bytes */
    char ID;         /* 1 byte  */
};
</pre>

I have found an answer to this question is a good way to learn about
different memory topics such as Byte addressable, endianness, data alignment, structure padding, and packing.

With arrays, it is trivial to know its size and how to access individaul elements. Assuming an integer is 32 bits.
An array of integers with 10 elements would have: 

<div align="center"><code>
(4) * 10 = 40 Bytes.
</code></div>

With structs data type, this question is tricky. If we try to do the same, adding individual elements together, we would have:

<div align="center"><code>
(char *) 8 + (char) 1 + (int) 4 = 13 Bytes.
</code></div>

But that's quite wrong as can be seen from the output of Pahole below, 
which is a utility program that could give you information about your data structres:

<pre>
struct human {
    int         age;        /*      0       4 */

    /* XXX 4 bytes hole, try to pack */

    char *      name;       /*      8       8 */
    char        ID;         /*      16      1 */

    /* size: 24, cachelines: 1, members: 3 */
    /* sum members: 13, holes: 1, sum holes: 4 */
    /* padding: 7 */
    /* last cacheline: 24 bytes */
};
</pre>


### Memory representation:

* Data is read from memory on chuncks of 1, 2, 4, 8, 10, and 16 bytes.
* Byte addressable

<table style="width:100%">
<tr>
    <th></th>
    <th>Byte 0</th>
    <th>Byte 1</th>
    <th>Byte 2</th>
    <th>Byte 3</th>
</tr>
<tr>
    <th>0x0000</th>
    <td>one</td>
    <td>two</td>
    <td>three</td>
    <td>four</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <th>0x0004</th>
    <td>one</td>
    <td>two</td>
    <td>three</td>
    <td>four</td>
</tr>
</table>

### Data Alignment &Structure Padding

Default alignment, pre determined boundary.

Additional bytes are inserted by the compiler to make the data elements aligned to word-size of the CPU.
Aligning the data elements to the word-size of the CPU by the compiler.

Padding is inserted either before a larger alignment requirement or at the end of the structure.
Thus, is's possible to change the amount of padding to reduce the memory requirment.
The minimal amount of alignment required is less than the largest alignment in the sturcutre.
Total size of the structure iz a multiple of the largest alignment of any structre member.

After organizing the elements, the size was reduced from 24 bytes to 16 bytes.

<pre>
struct human {
    char *      name;       /*      0       8 */
    int         age;        /*      12      4 */
    char        ID;         /*      8       1 */

    /* size: 16, cachelines: 1, members: 3 */
    /* padding: 3 */
    /* last cacheline: 16 bytes */
};
</pre>
