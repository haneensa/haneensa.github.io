If you have a struct like the following, could you predict its size?

<pre>
/* assuming 64 bit machine */
struct human {
    int age;        /* 4 bytes */
    char *name;     /* 8 bytes */
    char ID;         /* 1 byte  */
};
</pre>

I have found an answer to this question is a good way to learn about
different computer memory topics such as Byte addressable, endianness, data alignment, structure padding, and packing.

With arrays, it is trivial to know its size and how to access individaul elements. Assuming an integer is 32 bits.
An array of integers with 10 elements would have: (4) * 10 = 40 Bytes, and to access the third element, 
you would add an offset with value of: 4 * 3. 

With structs data type, this question is tricky. If we try to do the same, adding individual elements together, we would have:
(char *) 8 + (char) 1 + (int) 4 = 13 Bytes.

But that's quite wrong as can be seen from the output of Pahole below, 
which is a utility program that could give you information about your data structres:

<pre>
struct human {
    int         age;        /*      0       4 */

    /* XXX 4 bytes hole, try to pack */

    char *      name;       /*      8       8 */
    char        ID;         /*      16      1 */

    /* size: 24, cachelines: 1, members: 3 */
    /* sum members: 13, holes: 1, sum holes: 4 */
    /* padding: 7 */
    /* last cacheline: 24 bytes */
};
</pre>


Memory representation:
- how data is read from memory on chuncks

<table style="width:100%">
<tr>
    <th></th>
    <th>Byte 0</th>
    <th>Byte 1</th>
    <th>Byte 2</th>
    <th>Byte 3</th>
</tr>
<tr>
    <th>0x0000</th>
    <td>one</td>
    <td>two</td>
    <td>three</td>
    <td>four</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <th>0x0004</th>
    <td>one</td>
    <td>two</td>
    <td>three</td>
    <td>four</td>
</tr>
</table>
Byte addressable
Data Alignment &Structure Padding

Additional bytes are inserted by the compiler to make the data elements aligned to word-size of the CPU.
Aligning the data elements to the word-size of the CPU by the compiler.

each type except char has an alignment 


Structre Packing


After organizing the elements, the size was reduced from 24 bytes to 16 bytes.

<pre>
struct human {
    char *      name;       /*      0       8 */
    int         age;        /*      12      4 */
    char        ID;         /*      8       1 */

    /* size: 16, cachelines: 1, members: 3 */
    /* padding: 3 */
    /* last cacheline: 16 bytes */
};
</pre>
