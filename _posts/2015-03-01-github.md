Here are some of the common git sequence of commands stolen from StackOverFlow answers :D


- [Break specific commit into multiple commits](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6217156/break-a-previous-commit-into-multiple-commits)

1- Split apart your most recent commit:

```
$ git reset HEAD~
```

2- if you want older commit

```
$ git rebase -i HEAD~n
```

When you get the rebase edit screen, find the commit you want to break apart. At the beginning of that line, replace "pick" with "edit". Save the buffer and exit. Rebase will now stop just after the commit you want to edit. Then:

```
$ git reset HEAD~
```

Commit the pieces individually in the usual way, producing as many commits as you need, then

```
$ git rebase --continue
```
