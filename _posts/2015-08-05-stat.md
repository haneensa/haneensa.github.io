### Probablity

Events and how likly an event to occur out of a set of events.

### Combinatorics
- N choose K

$$ {n \choose x} $$

- permutations

### Random variables and Probability distributions

- Normal Distribution- Random variables

### Descriptive Statistics: <!-- what is it? how is it different than inferential?-->

1- Measures of Central Tendency: Mean, Median, variance, normal distribution

* Mean: The sum of all the numbers divided by the data points we have.
* Median: finding the middle number in an ordered set. In case you have two middle numbers, you would take their mean.
* Mode: The most common number in data set. 

2- Variance and Standard Deviation

- How spread apart data it is.
- Population vs. Sample
- Box and Whishker plot: Provide simple summary of a data set using only five points.

### Inferential Statistics:
- Normal Distribution
- Inferring population from sample mean
