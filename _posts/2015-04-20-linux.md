Almost two years ago, I've learned about an operating system that based on what my research told me is what 'real programmers use'. Before that, I didn't even know that it existed at all. 
My findings also told me that, it was for free! that anyone could download it and install it in their machines. 
Intrigued by what I've learned, and as I was in a mission to become one of the real programmers, I got determined to install it and use it as well. 

That discovery led me to the world of open source and free software. I fell in love yet I didn't know how to be part of that world. I've researched alot.
