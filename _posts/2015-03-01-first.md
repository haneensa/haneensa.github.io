Starting a blog was in my todo list since 2012. So, finally! 
I didn't know what I would write, but I wanted it to be a place for me where I can force myself to focus. Also, to master things I have learned, for I have noticed one learn best when he is able to explain it to others. And of course, to help me get better at writing. I really suck at it until now :s

Hope this would go as planned :D
