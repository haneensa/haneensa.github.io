Here are some of the common git sequence of commands stolen from Stack Over Flow answers for ease of refrence


---

<center class="muted">Break specific commit into multiple commits </center>

---

1- Split apart your most recent commit:

<pre>
$ git reset HEAD~
</pre>

2- if you want older commit

<pre>
$ git rebase -i HEAD~n
</pre>

When you get the rebase edit screen, find the commit you want to break apart. At the beginning of that line, replace "pick" with "edit". Save the buffer and exit. Rebase will now stop just after the commit you want to edit. Then:

<pre>
$ git reset HEAD~
</pre>

Commit the pieces individually in the usual way, producing as many commits as you need, then

<pre>
$ git rebase --continue
</pre>

---

<center class="muted">Beautifully print out git logs</center>

---
 
<pre>
$ git log --pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit
</pre>

---

<center class="muted">Patchset formatting and sending</center>

---

for Format patchset with cover letter, where N is number of patches you want to include

<pre>
$ git format-patch -o ~/dir/to/save/into -nN --cover-letter 
</pre>

Send patches via git ,ofcourse after you setup your email configuration proberly!



<pre>
$ git send-email --annotate ~/dir/of/patch/you/want/to/send
</pre>

---

<center class="muted">To go to a specific commit files</center>

---

<pre>
$ git checkout "SHA"
</pre>

then to return to the current assuming branch name is master

<pre>
$ git checkout master
</pre>

---

<center class="muted">Commands related to branching</center>

---

- To check current branches:

<pre>
$ git branch
</pre>

- To create new branch

<pre>
$ git branch name-of-branch
</pre>

- To change to particular branch

<pre>
$ git checkout name-of-branch
</pre>

- To delete a branch locally

<pre>
$ git branch -d the_local_branch
</pre>

- Amend specific commit:

X: the commit to modify

<pre>
$ git rebase --interactive X^
</pre>

In the default editor, modify 'pick' to 'edit' in the line whose commit you want to modify. Make your changes and then commit them with the same message you had before:

<pre>
$ git commit -a --amend --no-edit
$ git rebase --continue
</pre>

---

<center class="muted">Recovering from detached HEAD</center>

---

<pre>
$ git checkout -b temp "SHA"
</pre>

<pre>
$ git checkout -B master temp
</pre>

<pre>
$ git branch -d temp
</pre>
